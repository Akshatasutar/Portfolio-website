        <h1> About me </h1>
        <div id = "about-me">
            <p>
                I am Akshata Sutar, currently a third-year student of Computer Science,
                specialization in IoT at Kristianstad University, Sweden.
                </p>
                <p>
                Sometime in 2018, I took an online programming course in Python,
                which resulted in me falling in love with the art of problem solving and
                coding, and subsequently deciding to change my career from
                Architecture to computer science. Computer Science is the main focus of my career for now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I will always be grateful to architecture school for teaching me the fundamentals of good design, 
                to learn from criticism, to gracefully accept rejection, and kindling in me a love for model making.
                But I discovered quite early on that architecture was not the career for me, and 
                computer science seems more aligned to my interests and who I am as a person. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I don't believe people can be reduced to one characteristic, but if I had to do that for me,
                I would say I am curious and filled with wonder. You can often hear me say excitedly,
                "Ah! That's so COOL. I did not know that." This awareness that I will always be a beginner 
                at whatever I do makes me more open to learn new things. I truly believe there is no end 
                to learning. 
                </p>
